The QA Guild
============

The QA Guild spans multiple countries with team members throughout the USA, Brazil, China, Hungary, Italy, and Spain testing all of Liferay’s major products: Liferay Portal, DXP Cloud, Analytics Cloud, Commerce, Web, and Marketplace. 

At Liferay, it is our mission to make it possible for people to *reach their full potential to serve others*. It is imperative that we produce good, quality products to allow our customers to create solutions that will help them reach their goals. As a software company, part of the development process is Quality Assurance, which includes the continuous and thorough testing of products. As a guild, however, we want to advance the boundaries of our impact on quality by looking beyond the activity of testing. We want to go from being known as “Testers” to being known as “Quality Ambassadors,” who advocate for quality throughout the development process and not just during testing.

As a member of this guild, you join a group of individuals who are passionate about quality and are driven by a spirit of leadership, teamwork and collaboration, continuous improvement, and mentorship. 

* Leadership, Teamwork, and Collaboration - We *lead by serving others*. Regardless of position or title, we lead by example, we work harmoniously with our teams and we collaborate efficiently with other teams.
* Continuous Improvement - We *produce excellence* by testing the right things, in the right way, at the right time. 
* Mentorship - We *grow and get better*. We value people and invest in others’ growth as much as ours. We share the things we learn and we do not intentionally withhold information to advance ourselves at the expense of others. 

We are glad that you have joined QA, and we are looking forward to working with you, and as always, *stay nerdy*!
