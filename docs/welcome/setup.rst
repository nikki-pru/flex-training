Please make sure you have access to the following, or have it installed on your laptop. Some of these may have already been pre-installed on your laptop.

2. Google Chrome
3. An editor like Sublime 3 (download the license from `here`_) or `Visual Studio Code`_
4. Github account
5. Access to `QA contacts on Airtable`_
6. Access to issues.liferay.com (using your Liferay credentials)
7. JAVA jdk 8
8. MySQL 5.7

⚠️ After creating your GitHub account, ping your trainer or lead letting them know your GitHub username so they can request for you to be added to the Liferay organization.

⚠️On CMD/Terminal, check your JAVA version and MySQL version. Ping your trainer with the output/result. Restart your laptop and make sure your JAVA and MySQL version persist.

Hardware and Peripherals
-------------------------
You are welcome to bring your own keyboard and mouse to work but Liferay also provides these to employees. To request a keyboard, mouse or even a laptop stand, please create a `JIRA`_ ticket under the project **PRIVATE - Liferay IT (LRIT)**, with Issue Type - **New Hardware**. Add a short summary for the request,  similar to “Request for keyboard, mouse and laptop stand.” Leave the Assignee as “Automatic” so it gets automatically assigned to our IT Department. You may leave the rest of the fields blank.

Dongles and adapters are also provided should you need them to connect your laptop to your monitor or ethernet cable. There are multiple blue lego dongle boxes throughout the office spaces. The two closest ones would be on top of the cubbies on the other side of the room from QA, and in the Customer Service pods next to the printer. Ask your trainer or lead if you cannot locate the boxes.
