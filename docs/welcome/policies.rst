Policies and Guidelines
========================

.. note::
  Please review the `QA Guidelines for Remote Work`_. Reach out to your team or your lead should you run into any issues.

As a department we have some unwritten policies that we conduct our business by and are worth mentioning. 

First and foremost, we do not try to advance ourselves at someone else’s expense. For example, if you find some useful information that would most certainly help a team member, do not intentionally withhold that information to improve how you appear to management.  

Another is that we don’t waste time. There is always something to do or something to learn. Take the time to look for tasks, read training documents, follow up/close tickets that you previously worked on. If you find yourself completely without a task, reach out to your trainer or lead.
